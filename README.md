Clipsync is a program that allows synchronizing the clipboard between two computers using a shared file. The program monitors the clipboard for changes and writes the new content to the file. If the file changes, it updates the clipboard with the file's content. The file name can be specified through a file dialog, and the program provides an option to enable or disable automatic synchronization.

Instructions:

1. Launch the program.
2. Click on the "Set filename" button to open a file dialog.
3. Select a file where the clipboard content will be saved.
4. The selected file name will be displayed in the label.
5. If you want to enable synchronization, toggle the checkbox. The label will show "Sync ENABLED" if enabled.
6. Any changes made to the clipboard will be automatically saved to the file.
7. If the file content changes, it will be updated in the clipboard.
8. The content of the clipboard and the file will be displayed in the edit box.
